Text based adventure where you, the "Hero", fight against the Evil Wizard.
Your goal is to get the wizards health down to zero in order to win!
Don't forget to heal or you will suffer defeat.

There are four classes: 
Archer
Warrior
Paladin
Mage

Each Hero has a regular attack and a special ability.
I used a D & D style attack system where a number is chosen in the range of 1 - 20.

Same mechanics. If roll higher than the defender, then your attack is successful.
If you roll 20, its considered critical and deals * 1.5 extra damage.

This project taught me the use of class management and how to use __init__.py to package things together for import.
I also created my own slow_print function to make it seem like words were being typed on the screen.
